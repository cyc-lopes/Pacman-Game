This is an incredibly simple pacman game. The more you click, the better it gets!

You can play by following the link here: https://cyc-lopes.github.io/PacmanGame.github.io/


Some future improvements would be:

- having the PacMen chase your mouse around the screen
- being able to change from PacMen to other characters
- adding sound effects or visual effects whenever a PacMan hits the wall
