# Pacman Game

This is an incredibly simple pacman game. The more you click, the better it gets!

In order to run this program on your machine, you will need to click the green "CODE" button above the files, download the zip, extract all the files, and drag the HTML file onto your browser in a new tab. Once it's loaded, you can click the "Start Game" button, and then click the "Add PacMan" button until you've added as many Pacmen to the screen as you'd like.

Some future improvements would be:

- having the PacMen chase your mouse around the screen
- being able to change from PacMen to other characters
- adding sound effects or visual effects whenever a PacMan hits the edge of the screen
