This is an incredibly simple pacman game. The more you click, the better it gets!

In order to play, just click the start game button, and then add as many PacMen to the game as your heart desires.

Some future improvements would be:

- having the PacMen chase your mouse around the screen
- being able to change from PacMen to other characters
- adding sound effects or visual effects whenever a PacMan hits the edge of the screen
